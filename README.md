# MobilePose

Implementations of various pose estimation models with the goal of efficient inference for mobile devices. The implemented models are listed below (though I've modified them):

* [LSTM Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06316.pdf) (CVPR '18)
* [Instance Segmentation and Tracking with Cosine Embeddings and Recurrent Hourglass Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02070.pdf)
