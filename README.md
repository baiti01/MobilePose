# MobilePose

Implementations of various pose estimation models with the goal of efficient inference for mobile devices. The models derive from the following papers:

* [LSTM Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06316.pdf)
* [Instance Segmentation and Tracking with Cosine Embeddings and Recurrent Hourglass Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02070.pdf)
* [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381.pdf)
* [Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf)
